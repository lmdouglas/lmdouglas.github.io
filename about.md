Hello! My name is Lauren and I have started this site as a pet project. I wanted somewhere centralised to document my forays into the various aspects of data science and machine learning. I’m definitely somebody that needs to take notes in order to learn, and I am also definitely somebody who needs to play around and ‘get a feel’ for everything in order to learn. Setting up a GitHub Pages seemed to be great way to kill two birds!* Git isn’t trivial but it is a skill I am wanting to learn. Also the ability to get out there information & plots without havi ng to set up a full on website, but with a setup that means I can play around with and customise how the site looks is excellent.

*No animals were harmed in the making of this website.
